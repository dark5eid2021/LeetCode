# Staff Engineer Interview: Sliding Window Maximum

## Problem Analysis (30 seconds)
- Classic sliding window optimization problem
- Naive O(nk) approach is unacceptable at staff level
- Need O(n) solution with efficient data structure

## Solution Approach
**Monotonic Deque Strategy:**
- Store indices in deque, maintaining decreasing order of values
- Front of deque = current window maximum
- Remove expired indices and dominated elements efficiently

## Key Technical Points

### Why Deque is Optimal
- O(1) insertion/deletion at both ends
- Each element processed exactly once â†’ O(n) amortized
- Maintains both temporal and value ordering
- Space complexity O(k) worst case, often much better

### Algorithm Invariants
- Indices stored in increasing temporal order
- Values at those indices in decreasing order  
- Front element always represents current window maximum

### Staff-Level Considerations
- **Scalability**: Algorithm handles streaming data naturally
- **Memory efficiency**: Space usage typically << O(k)
- **Cache friendly**: Sequential access patterns
- **Production ready**: Handles all edge cases cleanly

## Follow-up Questions to Expect
- **Sliding window minimum**: Same approach, reverse comparisons
- **Min and max together**: Two deques, same complexity
- **Streaming data**: Algorithm works unchanged
- **Distributed processing**: Can partition input efficiently

## Real-World Applications
- System monitoring (CPU/memory peak detection)
- Financial analysis (price movement windows)  
- Network traffic analysis
- Time series anomaly detection

## Why This Matters at Staff Level
- Demonstrates advanced algorithmic thinking
- Shows understanding of amortized complexity
- Clean, production-ready code structure
- Considers real-world scalability concerns
